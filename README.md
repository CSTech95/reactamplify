This app was for a software engineering class where we learned the waterfall model and other software development life cycles. I was the team lead responsible for backend development. This app is a car rental web application. I suggested an ecommerce app to my group so that we can better understand the waterfall model.

Tech used:

  React Native (I've work with React.js a lot and had fun learning React Native for this project)
  
  
  Javascript (I use Javascript the most when doing projects. I've been picking up typescript and enjoy it)
  
  
  GraphQL (Not too familiar with graphQL but the professor wanted us to learn new things. I have more experience with restful API development)
  
  
  AWS Amplify (First time using Amplify. I mainly use AWS when working with the cloud. AWS is very strong and I love the plethora of their services)
  
  
  AWS Cognito (I've used cognito before once and strengthen my knowledge/skills on it with this project)
  
  
  AWS DynamoDB (First time I worked with DynamoDB & had a great time working with it. I feel I'll use this db again in future but for now learning RDS)
